If a predator detects the octopus and attacks the sand, the octopus can crawl out of reach of the attacker through the sand. This octopus can bury very quickly by producing its own quicksand. It pumps fast jets of water into the sand making the sand bubble and loosen. It then dives in before the sand resettles. It is possible that females release a sexually attractive chemical as groups of males have been observed swarming over single females.

The female lives in a white paper-thin shell (often called a \"paper nautilus\") that reaches around 27 cm long. The female reaches about 27 cm long. The common name of this octopus comes from the knobbed ridges across the sides of the shell. The female has a round body and eight arms, each with two rows of suckers. The first arm pair has two wide webs at the ends. These webs both secrete the white shell and are spread over the outside of the shell when the animal is swimming. The webs can change colour from silver to dark maroon red. The male is much smaller, being less than 3 cm long. It has no shell, a rounded body and large eyes. It has eight arms each with two rows of suckers. The third left arm is much longer and highly modified. It develops in a pouch that reaches around the same size as the body.

Like other argonaut species it is presumed to feed on pelagic molluscs (particularly heteropods and pteropods), small fishes and crustaceans. Mating in argonauts is very unusual. When a tiny male argonaut encounters a female he ruptures a pouch containing a special reproductive arm. He loads this arm with sperm, detaches it and passes it to the female. Once the arm is shed it is believed that the male argonaut dies. The detached arm crawls into the gill cavity of the female where it attaches to her gills and is stored until it is required for fertilisation. Single females have been found with the arms of multiple males attached to their gills. Eggs are laid in strings attached to the inner core of the female\u0027s shell and protected until they hatch. Hatchlings are transparent and are often full of yolk, providing their first meals as they disperse and start fending for themselves. Large swarms of this argonaut wash ashore at irregular intervals along the southern Australian coast. There appears to be no set cycle in these mass strandings with currents, winds, krill schools and lunar cycles all being speculated as the causes. Beach washed shells are popular in the shell trade. Word quickly spreads when strandings occur with some collectors picking up hundreds of shells in a night.","diet":"Carnivore","habitat":"Surface waters of open-ocean, may be found in shallow coastal waters or stranded on the beach following periods of onshore winds.

This species of blue-ringed octopus has lost the ability to produce ink. It is possible that the strong toxins are enough to protect this octopus. Other members of the group can still produce ink. Mating occurs by males approaching females and climbing on to their bodies. The male inserts his third right arm into the female\u0027s gill cavity and passes sperm packets into her oviducts.

Day-foraging animals are often accompanied by wrasses that grab any prey that escape the octopus\u0027 clutches. Mating occurs by the male engulfing the female within his webs and inserting the modified third right arm into her gill cavity to place sperm packets in her oviducts. The females lay strings of small eggs, attaching them to hard surfaces such as in rock crevices. The young hatch as planktonic young that travel in ocean currents between Australia and New Zealand. This octopus is harvested in both targeted fisheries and as bycatch. It is used for human consumption (often pickled in the Greek style) and as bait.

Younger animals form small schools, with larger adults tending to be more solitary. They are fast swimmers, using both the fins and jet propulsion. They primarily feed on fish and shrimp and will regularly approach divers lights at night to catch fish attracted to the lights. Their main defences are high speed jetting and ink squirting but they are also capable of good camouflage amongst weed. Mating consists of males placing sperm packages within the gill cavity of the female. Females lay finger-like strings of white fleshy eggs amongst weed. Each string contains around six eggs, the separate egg segments becoming more obvious as the eggs mature. This squid is very popular for human consumption. It is caught as bycatch in trawl fisheries. Spawning aggregations are targeted as a small-scale fishery in Tasmania and South Australia. It is also very popular with recreational fishermen who use baitless jigs and long jig poles to fish from piers and jetties at dusk.","diet":"Carnivore","habitat":"Shallow inshore waters, often in sand habitats and seagrass meadows, usually to depth of 20 m, recorded to 68 m.","nativeStatus":"Native to Australia","distinctive":"10 arms and tentacles, fins extend entire length of body to form diamond shape.","distribution":"New Zealand and southern Australia, including Victorian waters.","conservationStatuses":[{"authority":"DSE Advisory List","status":"Not listed"},{"authority":"EPBC Act 1999","status":"Not listed"},{"authority":"IUCN Red List","status":"Not listed"}],"depth":["Shallow (1-30 m)","Deep ( \u003e 30 m)"],"location":["Midwater"],"isCommercial":true,"taxaPhylum":"Mollusca","taxaClass":"Cephalopoda","taxaOrder":"Teuthida","taxaFamily":"Loliginidae","taxaGenus":"Sepioteuthis","taxaSpecies":"australis","commonNames":"Southern Calamari Squid","otherNames":""},"images":[{"filename":"389909.jpg","imageDescription":"\u003cem\u003eSepioteuthis australis\u003c/em\u003e, close-up of head.","credit":"Mark Norman / Museum Victoria"},{"filename":"389908.jpg","imageDescription":"\u003cem\u003eSepioteuthis australis\u003c/em\u003e, above sand.","credit":"Julian Finn / Museum Victoria"},{"filename":"389907.jpg","imageDescription":"\u003cem\u003eSepioteuthis australis\u003c/em\u003e, above sand.","credit":"Julian Finn / Museum Victoria"}]},{"identifier":"7307","label":"Frilled Pygmy Octopus","sublabel":"Octopus superciliosus","searchText":" Octopuses allies Octopuses Frilled Pygmy Octopus Octopus superciliosus","squareThumbnail":"525842.jpg","group":"Octopuses and allies","subgroup":"Octopuses","details":{"description":"Small, pygmy octopus.

The only record of a wild observation was a single animal camouflaged as a piece of red seaweed, hitching a ride on the back of a large shellfish, a Wavy Volute. It is assumed that they eat crustaceans like most other octopus species. Pygmy octopuses have probably evolved from the pressures to remain hidden. Octopuses make an excellent meal; they lack spines or armour and most lack poisons. Being small helps them to remain hidden from larger fish predators. Some pygmy octopuses spend most of their lives hidden in the roots of kelps or small coral heads, feeding on the many small crustaceans and fish that also seek shelter in these refuges. Natural selection would favour octopuses that mature at smaller sizes so that they can reproduce without being forced out of their safe havens.
